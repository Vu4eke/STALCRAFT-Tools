## Reporting a Vulnerability

There is no script responsibility for the loss of a character in the game, since the outcome depends on the game actions of the participants.
To send a suggestion or report a bug on the Discord support server, follow the link: https://discord.gg/yHez7BFXyE . Your contribution will help improve the gameplay and create a better gaming experience for all players.
